> ask the UI/UX agent to review the current UI/UX of the app. 

⏺ I'll engage the UX/UI excellence architect agent to conduct a
  comprehensive review of your application's user interface and experience.

⏺ ux-ui-excellence-architect(Comprehensive UI/UX review)
  ⎿  Done (18 tool uses · 99.0k tokens · 2m 58s)                           

⏺ The UX/UI excellence architect has completed a comprehensive review of
  your application. Here's what was found:

  Executive Summary

  Your financial planning app has solid technical foundations but needs
  significant UX polish to reach world-class standards. The review
  identified 3 critical issues, 7 high-priority issues, and numerous
  medium/low priority enhancements.

  Key Findings:

  Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

  1. Inconsistent Loading States - Users don't know if the system is
  working, leading to frustration and repeated clicks
  2. Poor Form Validation Feedback - Errors appear inconsistently, causing
  preventable user mistakes
  3. Missing Breadcrumbs - Users get lost in deep navigation hierarchies
  (3-4 levels deep)

  High Priority Issues

  1. Weak Visual Hierarchy - Dense pages lack clear information structure
  2. Tab State Not Persisted - Can't share specific views, browser back
  button doesn't work
  3. Generic Empty States - No guidance on what to do when there's no data
  4. Complex Forms Overwhelming - All fields shown at once instead of
  progressive disclosure
  5. Minimal Async Operation Feedback - Long calculations lack progress
  indicators

  Quick Wins (1 week, 40% improvement)

  The review identified 8 quick wins that take ~42 hours total but deliver
  30-40% improvement in user satisfaction:
  - Add loading messages (2h)
  - Improve button hierarchy (4h)
  - Add breadcrumbs (6h)
  - Enhance empty states (4h)
  - Add field-level validation (8h)
  - Better error messages (4h)
  - Keyboard shortcuts (8h)
  - Fix mobile touch targets (6h)

  Recommended Action Plan

  Sprint 1-2 (Weeks 1-2): Fix critical issues - loading states, breadcrumbs,
   validation
  Sprint 3-4 (Weeks 3-4): High-impact enhancements - forms, tabs, keyboard
  nav
  Sprint 5-6 (Weeks 5-6): Accessibility & mobile optimization
  Sprint 7-8 (Weeks 7-8): Advanced features - interactive charts, auto-save

  Would you like me to start implementing any of these recommendations? I'd
  suggest starting with the critical issues for maximum impact.
